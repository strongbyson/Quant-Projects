## Project Overview
This project develops a trading strategy that uses the VIX index (a measure of market volatility) to trade UVXY, an exchange-traded fund that tracks VIX futures. The strategy is implemented in Python using the `pandas` library for data manipulation and runs in Google Colab for easy access and execution.

The goal is to simulate trading decisions based on VIX thresholds, track the total trading capital, and calculate profits over time. The project includes a sample dataset (`Trade Data.csv`) with VIX and UVXY prices, but users can replace it with their own data.

## Trading Strategy Rules
The trading strategy follows these rules:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initial trading capital: $1,000,000.
   - First trade amount: $10,000.
   - Available trade capital: Always 80% of the total trading capital.
   - Trade counter: Starts at 0 and increments with each short trade; resets after a buy-back.
   - Units traded: Starts at 0 and accumulates with each trade.

2. **Short UVXY (Sell)**:
   - Trigger: When VIX is greater than 20 and VIX increases by more than 0.5 from the previous VIX value (`prev_vix + 0.5`).
   - Trade Amount:
     - If `trade_counter = 0`, trade amount = $10,000.
     - If `trade_counter > 0`, trade amount = `trade_counter * $10,000`.
   - Condition: Trade only if the trade amount is less than the available trade capital.
   - Action:
     - Calculate units traded: `trade_amount / uvxy_price`.
     - Add units to `cumulative_units_traded`.
     - Add trade amount to `total_trading_capital`.
     - Increment `trade_counter`.
     - Update `prev_vix` to the current VIX value.

3. **Buy Back UVXY**:
   - Trigger: When VIX falls below 19.
   - Condition: Only if `cumulative_units_traded > 0`.
   - Action:
     - Calculate buy-back amount: `cumulative_units_traded * uvxy_price`.
     - Deduct buy-back amount from `total_trading_capital`.
     - Reset `cumulative_units_traded` to 0.
     - Reset `trade_counter` to 0.
     - Update `prev_vix` to the current VIX value.

4. **Do Nothing**:
   - Trigger: When VIX is between 19 and 20 (inclusive).
   - Action: No trade is executed; continue to the next row.

5. **Profit Calculation**:
   - Profit is calculated as `total_trading_capital - initial_trading_capital` at each step.

## Files
- **`Trading_Strategy.ipynb`**: The main Google Colab notebook containing the trading strategy implementation.
- **`Trade Data.csv`**: A sample dataset with VIX and UVXY prices.
- **`trade_data_export.csv`**: The output file generated by the notebook, containing the updated DataFrame with trading details (e.g., `sell_amount`, `units_traded`, `profit`).
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing documentation for the project.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, youâ€™ll need:
- A Google account to use Google Colab.
- A GitHub account (optional, for cloning the repository).
- A CSV file with VIX and UVXY data (you can use the provided `Trade Data.csv` file).

## Dependencies
The project uses the following Python libraries, which are pre-installed in Google Colab:

pandas: For data manipulation and DataFrame operations.
numpy: For numerical operations (e.g., handling np.nan).
matplotlib: For plotting (optional, if you add visualizations).
google.colab: For file uploads/downloads and Google Drive integration in Colab.
